/**
 * Main entry point for the Micro Engine.

 * Design goals:
 * - correct division of OpenGL into appropriate wrapper classes
 * - simple design
 * - each class should know as little as possible about other classes and non related parts of OpenGL
 * - the engine must allow different objects with different transforms, meshes, materials (shaders) etc
 * - consistent coding conventions
 * - reusable and extendable core set of classes which should require no modification
 *   (in other words it is possible to have a working "empty" example)
 *
 * All documentation is contained within the HEADER files, not the CPP files in possible.
